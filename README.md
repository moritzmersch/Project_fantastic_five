Prediction of solar energy production based on historical weather data.

As part of the TechLabs Data Science Track, winter term 2021/2022 we created our first Data Science project.
Based on historical weather and solar data, we created a simple linear regression model to predict the future solar energy production for two different locations. The goal is to point out possibilities for clean energy production and therefore contribute to the 7th sustainable development goal - affordable and clean energy.
